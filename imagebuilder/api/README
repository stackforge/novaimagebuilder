WARNING:
-------
THIS IS STILL VERY BUGGY!
1) The response on the POST doesn't work with every client.
2) The responses are all str instead of real objects.


REQUIREMENTS:
------------
Requires pecan and wsme

On Fedora, install the packages python-pecan and python-wsme


RUNNING:
-------
For now, run the following:

    image-building-poc% pecan serve openstack-imagebuilder/api/config.py


- Once the server starts, use HTTPie or curl to POST to /osib/v1/builds
    ex
        http --json POST localhost:8080/osib/v1/builds

- Now you can GET that object using the '_id'
    ex
        http --json localhost:8080/osib/v1/builds/51a9293ff731080a5ac2a24b
